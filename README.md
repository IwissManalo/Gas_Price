# â›½ Gas Price Fluctuation Analysis ðŸ¤”

This Python program simulates gas price fluctuations over 100 days and analyzes the data to provide insights such as the best and worst days to fill up gas, along with the probability of price reduction per day. It utilizes NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for linear regression modeling. The script also generates a plot illustrating the gas price trend over the simulated period.
